# Sudoku App — Repository Guide

Cross-platform (iOS + Android) Sudoku game built with **React Native + Expo
(TypeScript)**. Offline-first, with a clean separation that lets a backend
(analytics, accounts, cloud sync) be plugged in later without rewriting the app.

## Identity
- App name: **Sudoku**
- Bundle id: **dev.alejandrodelacruz.sudoku**
- Min OS: Expo defaults

## Tech stack
- **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **Expo** (managed) + **Expo Router** (file-based navigation)
- **Zustand** (+ `persist` middleware) for state
- **react-native-mmkv** for persistence — requires an Expo **dev client**
  (`expo prebuild` / `expo run:ios|android`); does **not** run in plain Expo Go
- **Jest** + `@testing-library/react-native` for tests
- **ESLint + Prettier**

## Architecture — layered Clean Architecture

Dependencies point **downward only**. UI → State → Domain + Data interfaces.
The Domain layer depends on nothing.

```
UI layer       (React Native components + screens)   ← Expo, Expo Router
State layer    (Zustand stores + selectors)          ← orchestrates engine + repos
Domain layer   (pure TS: engine, rules, types)       ← NO framework/storage imports
Data layer     (repository interfaces + impls)       ← swappable: local now, API later
```

### Golden rule
**`src/domain/` is pure TypeScript** — zero React, Expo, or storage imports. It
must run unchanged in tests, on a server, or in a future web build. Never import
React or a repository implementation into `domain/`.

Concrete repository implementations are **never imported** by UI/State directly.
They are wired in one **composition root** (`src/data/index.ts`) and injected.
This is the seam that makes the backend pluggable.

## Domain model

- Board is a **flat 81-cell array**: `index = row * 9 + col`.
- `Cell = { value: number | null; given: boolean; notes: Set<number> }`.
- All board updates are **immutable** (new objects each move) — makes undo and
  React re-render detection trivial.
- `Difficulty = 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard' | 'expert' | 'extreme'`.
- Undo is snapshot-based: each `Move` stores the affected cell's prior state;
  undo restores it. One mechanism serves place/note/erase/fast-pencil (batched).

### Feature → engine mapping
- **Validated pencil notes** → `toggleNote` checks peers via `rules` first.
- **Fast mode** → `gameStore.selectedDigit`; tapping cells applies that digit.
- **Fast Pencil** → `computeAutoNotes(board)` applied as one undoable batch.
- **Timer/pause, mistakes, remaining counts, highlights** → `gameStore` slices +
  `selectors`.

## Data & backend extensibility
- Every external dependency sits behind an interface in `data/repositories/`.
- Swap local → remote by changing wiring in `data/index.ts` only.
- **Analytics from day one:** the State layer emits events
  (`game_started`, `move_made`, `hint_used`, `game_completed`, `mistake_made`)
  through `StatsRepository`. Today it writes locally; later, swap the repo —
  no app instrumentation changes needed.

## Puzzles
- Source: Kaggle "3 million Sudoku puzzles with ratings" (license approved).
- `scripts/build-puzzle-bank.ts` runs **offline at dev time** (not in-app):
  buckets puzzles into the 5 difficulty tiers by rating, samples N per tier,
  emits `assets/puzzles/<difficulty>.json`.
- `BundledPuzzleRepository` serves a random unused puzzle per difficulty,
  tracking played ids to avoid repeats.
- **Future:** replace with an on-device generator implementing the same
  `PuzzleRepository` interface — no app changes.

## Persistence
- In-progress game auto-saved to MMKV after each move (board, notes, timer,
  mistakes, undo stack) → resume after app kill.
- Settings (selected theme, default fast mode, sound) via Zustand `persist`.
- Played puzzle ids / basic stats stored locally (also feed `LocalStatsRepository`).

## Commands
- Install: `npm install`
- Dev (dev client, required by MMKV): `npx expo run:ios` / `npx expo run:android`
- Tests: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Build puzzle banks (offline): `npx tsx scripts/build-puzzle-bank.ts`

## Conventions
- Keep `domain/` free of framework/storage imports — enforce in review.
- UI/State import repository **interfaces**, never `local/` or `remote/` impls.
- Prefer Zustand **selectors** over whole-store subscriptions to limit re-renders.
- New external capability → add an interface in `repositories/`, a local impl,
  and wire it in the composition root.
