# Sudoku

Cross-platform (iOS + Android) Sudoku game built with React Native + Expo.
Offline-first, with a clean architecture that lets a backend be plugged in later
without rewriting the app. See [`.claude/CLAUDE.md`](.claude/CLAUDE.md) for the
full architecture guide.

## Features

- **Pencil notes** with validation — illegal notes (value already in the same
  row/column/box) are blocked.
- **Fast Mode** (number-first): pick a digit, then tap cells to place it repeatedly.
- **Fast Pencil**: auto-fill every empty cell's legal candidates in one undoable step.
- **Timer** with pause, **mistakes** counter, **undo**, **erase**.
- **5 difficulties** (easy → extreme) served from a bundled, offline puzzle bank.
- **Theme palette** — multiple selectable color themes.

## Stack

- TypeScript (strict), Expo + Expo Router
- Zustand (state) + react-native-mmkv (persistence)
- Jest for the pure-TypeScript game engine and data layer

## Develop

react-native-mmkv requires a dev client, so use the native run commands (not Expo Go):

```bash
npm install
npm run ios       # or: npm run android  (runs expo prebuild + native build)
```

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Puzzles

A starter bank is committed under `assets/puzzles/`. Regenerate or rebuild it:

```bash
npm run build:puzzles                          # generate a fresh starter bank
PER_TIER=200 npm run build:puzzles             # more puzzles per tier
PUZZLE_CSV=path/to/kaggle.csv npm run build:puzzles   # build from the Kaggle dataset
```

The Kaggle source is "3 million Sudoku puzzles with ratings". Swapping to
on-device generation later means implementing `PuzzleRepository` — no app changes.
